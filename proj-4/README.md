# Forward and reverse Proxy setup using AWS

In this project we will be trying forward proxy as well as reverse proxy setup

A forward proxy sits between clients (like browsers or applications) and external servers.
Clients send all requests to the proxy, which then makes requests to the internet on their behalf.
This is useful for:

- Controlling outbound internet access

- Caching responses

- Adding authentication or logging

- Masking internal network details
